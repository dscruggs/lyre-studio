# Voice Project

This is a project to do the following w/ either voice or text:

1. Modifying my voice with some non-ML transformations (think shifting pitch, distortion, etc.). The goal here would be to make funny voices. There would probably be knobs to tune or presets you could pick from (like the boneless pizza video).
2. Keeping your same voice but changing languages or accents, this would be done with a prompt or have a few presets
3. Changing your voice to sound like a celebrity or something
4. You could do some interesting combinations of all of the above


Progress:
- I finished #2 for changing languages. Accents might be a challenge so we'll put that on the backburner
- Changing voice to sound like celebrity (#3) can be done with the same stack as #2, just need to change some things around and figure out how to work with sound clips instead of recordings. Right now there's some bugs
- I'd like to see if I can speed up inference in any way here
- I have not played around with pedalboard, that will be my approach for #1
- After I have pedalboard figured out I'd like to design the UI to do both of those things. The celebrity thing I can design in and figure out later cause I think I'm close. I'd like to have a cool demo by next week and then can improve from there
